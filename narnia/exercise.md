**Fix this Flask application and the problems it has:**

Use provided credentials to log in: username - **code** password - **academy**

1. _If launching the application, the user is greeted with an error message._
2. _If logged in, the username is not shown in the navbar, instead we get this message - "Hello, WHAT?!!"._
3. _After logging in, the user is redirected to register again!_
4. _Logout is not working._
5. _Newly registered users are not able to log in. Why? Can you fix that?_

**2.1** :
Modify this exercise code and convert all Flask HTML forms to Flask WTF forms.
